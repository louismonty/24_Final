In the present project, we developed a Matador game based on Danish rulesets for Windows 10 home edition users. The project followed a Unified Process style of workflow including the following two phases: elaboration and construction. The analyses for the project included a requirements specification, use-case analysis and a domain analysis. The designs for the project included a system-sequence, sequence and design class analysis. The implementation resulted in a playable Matador game with no apparent errors or bugs. To reduce the risk of undetected bugs, JUnit tests were conducted for selected relevant software classes along with user tests for the entire program.
